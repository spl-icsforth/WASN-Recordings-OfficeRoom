## Short description

The dataset is comprised of speech recordings of two male speakers at different locations. The recordings were made at a typical office environment (the reverberation time was approximately equal to 400 ms). For recording we used two circular 8-element microphone arrays (5cm radius) with were placed very close to the walls and at different locations in the room.
